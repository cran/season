\title{season: Tools for Uncovering and Estimating Seasonal Patterns.}
\description{
The package contains graphical methods for displaying seasonal data and
regression models for detecting and estimating seasonal patterns.
}
\details{
The regression models can be applied to normal, Poisson or binomial
dependent data distributions. Tools are available for both time series data
(equally spaced in time) and survey data (unequally spaced in time).

Sinusoidal (parametric) seasonal patterns are available
(\code{\link{cosinor}}, \code{\link{nscosinor}}), as well as models for
monthly data (\code{\link{monthglm}}), and the case-crossover method to
control for seasonality (\code{\link{casecross}}).

\code{season} aims to fill an important gap in the software by providing a
range of tools for analysing seasonal data. The examples are based on health
data, but the functions are equally applicable to any data with a seasonal
pattern.
