# season
R package to run seasonal analyses. For details see our book "Analysing Seasonal Health Data" (2010) https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642107474.

Two useful functions are `casecross` for case-crossover analysis and `nscosinor` to estimate non-stationary seasonal patterns using the Kalman filter.
