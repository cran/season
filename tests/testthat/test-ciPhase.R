## Expected outputs were determined by calculating +/-(pi/2)*0.95 as the hypothetical 
## Quantiles for a unit circle uniformly populated (and saturated) on its right hand side. 
##This yields a 95% Confidence interval 0f +/-1.492257
## the vector constructed above is arbitrarily close to this when run through ciPhase,
##so current outputs are hardcoded in as the expected outputs.
